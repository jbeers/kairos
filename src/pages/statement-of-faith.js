        <h1>Kairos Church Statement of Faith</h1>
        <p>
            We believe in God,<br />
            the Father almighty,<br />
            Creator of heaven and earth,<br />
            and in Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord,<br />
            who was conceived by the Holy Spirit,<br />
            born of the Virgin Mary,<br />
            suffered under PonDus Pilate,<br />
            was crucified, died and was buried;<br />
            he descended into hell;<br />
            on the third day he rose again from the dead;<br />
            he ascended into heaven,<br />
            and is seated at the right hand of God the Father almighty;<br />
            from there he will come to judge the living and the dead.
        </p>
        <p>
            We believe in the Holy Spirit,<br />
            the holy Church,<br />
            the communion of saints,<br />
            the forgiveness of sins,<br />
            the resurrecDon of the body,<br />
            and life everlasting.
        </p>

        <p>
            We believe that God has given the church the five-fold ministry of apostles, prophets, evangelists, teachers, and
            pastors. Each of these voices bring unique value to the body of Christ. Every ChrisDan can grow in these giLings.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Apostle – believers sent by God to break new ground and call people into their desDny</li>
            <li>Prophet – believers who hear the word of the Lord for the present situaDon</li>
            <li>Evangelist – believers who have a passion to reach the lost with the good news</li>
            <li>Teacher – believers who equip and train others in applying the scriptures in pracDcal ways</li>
            <li>Pastor – believers who care for the body of Christ providing comfort, counseling, and support</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            We believe that the giLs of the Spirit are acDve today. The giLs of the Spirit include a word of wisdom, a word of
            knowledge, faith, giLs of healings, working of miracles, prophecy, discerning of spirits, different kinds of tongues,
            and interpretaDon of tongues.
        </p>
        <p>
            We believe that God has created man and woman in his image, so gender is important to how God has created
            each of us. We believe that marriage is between a man and woman and reveals his love. We believe that God
            intends sexuality as an expression of love within marriage. We believe that, though humans have natural desires
            and urges, God has called us to submit these desires and urges to the truth of God’s plan.
