# Kairos Church Website

This is the repository for kairos-church.com

## To-Do List

* Add social media icons to top of site
* Add social media icons to footer
* Make the whole site more accessible to visitors
    * Create a get-in-touch component to place on each page
    * Place a map on the home page
    * Could this componenet be a map+contact form?
* Incorporate links to the latest sermons - use the vimeo rss feed https://vimeo.com/kairoskc/videos/rss
* Create a learship page with photos and bios
* Make the forms submit and send an email or something

## Possibilities
* use facebook messenger as the platform for the get in touch chat system
* could we use the already made vimeo plugins for gatsby
* have the forms pragmatically send the messages to the correct person so as to not directly expose their e-mail adresses to the public in a manor in which web scrapers could gather them to send spam
* add a resources page to the site that includes
   * links to the churches app for apple and android
   * bible reding plans for reading the bible in a year 
      * Chronologically
      * Cannonically
      * Passages from old and new testaments every day
* Keep homepage clean and just put the map in the footer under the social media links iin the footer
